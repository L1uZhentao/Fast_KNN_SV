# Fast Implementaion of KNN Shapley Value Computation
This is course project at ETHZ "Write Fast Code For Machine Learning Algorithm"

Data valuation, the process of distributing values to data
points, becomes essential due to data commoditization. This
paper proposes various optimizations for two data valuation algorithms which can compute Shapley Values (SV) for K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifiers. Experiments show that the optimized implementation of both algorithms has achieved significant speed-up.
